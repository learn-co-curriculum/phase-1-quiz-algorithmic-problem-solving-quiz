# Question 3

Calculate the **time complexity** for the following code using Big O notation:

```javascript
function logLetter(string) {
  for (const letter of string) {
    console.log(letter);
  }
}
```

## Correct

O(n)

> Correct! Since the algorithm needs to iterate through each letter of the
> input, the time complexity will grow in linear proportion to the size of the
> input.

## Incorrect

O(1)

> Not quite. O(1) would mean the algorithm's runtime stays the same regardless
> of how large the input is.

## Incorrect

O(n²)

> Not quite. O(n²) would mean the algorithm's runtime grows exponentially as the
> size of the input grows, like an algorithm that involved a nested loop.

## Incorrect

O(log n)

> Not quite. O(log n) would mean that the algorithm's time complexity grows in a
> logarithmic proportion to the size of the input (so an input of size 1 would
> take 1 step, size 10 would take 2 steps, size 100 would take 3 steps, etc).

## Incorrect

I don't know
