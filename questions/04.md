# Question 5

Calculate the **time complexity** for the following code using Big O notation:

```javascript
function findIndexOfElement(array, target) {
  return array.indexOf(target);
}
```

## Correct

O(n)

> Correct! Even though we're building a built-in method, the JavaScript engine
> would still need to iterate over every element of the input array under the
> hood in order to find the index position of the target element.

## Incorrect

O(1)

> Not quite. O(1) would mean the algorithm's runtime stays the same regardless
> of how large the input is. Even though we're using a built-in method, the
> JavaScript engine still needs to iterate over every element of the input array
> under the hood in order to find the index position of the target element.

## Incorrect

O(n²)

> Not quite. O(n²) would mean the algorithm's runtime grows exponentially as the
> size of the input grows, like an algorithm that involved a nested loop.

## Incorrect

O(log n)

> Not quite. O(log n) would mean that the algorithm's time complexity grows in a
> logarithmic proportion to the size of the input (so an input of size 1 would
> take 1 step, size 10 would take 2 steps, size 100 would take 3 steps, etc).

## Incorrect

I don't know
