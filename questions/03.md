# Question 4

Calculate the **time complexity** for the following code using Big O notation:

```javascript
function badCounting(array) {
  let count = 0;
  array.forEach((value, idx) => {
    array.forEach((testValue, testIdx) => {
      if (testIdx !== idx && value === testValue) {
        count++;
      }
    });
  });
  return count / 2;
}
```

## Correct

O(nÂ²)

> Correct! Since this algorithm comparing each element against each other
> element in this array, as the size of the input array grows, the runtime gets
> exponentially worse.

## Incorrect

O(n)

> Now quite. O(n) would mean the time complexity will grow in linear proportion
> to the size of the input.

## Incorrect

O(1)

> Not quite. O(1) would mean the algorithm's runtime stays the same regardless
> of how large the input is.

## Incorrect

O(log n)

> Not quite. O(log n) would mean that the algorithm's time complexity grows in a
> logarithmic proportion to the size of the input (so an input of size 1 would
> take 1 step, size 10 would take 2 steps, size 100 would take 3 steps, etc).

## Incorrect

I don't know
